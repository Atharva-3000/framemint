I wanna make one website, the basic functionality is that the website will allow teh user to capture an aimge from there laptop or phone and then that photo will be viewed there with a banner running across its width in some angle like we have those caution do not enter type, this banner will have an event name, so keep this banner modular, like image and text and stuff. also after capturing we will ask the user if the image is good or retake the image, after the image is deemed good, the user will be able to mint that image, we are only responsible for creating the homepage and not the backend or integration of smart contracts part, we need to just ask the user to connect there wallet and then capture the aimge, we will be showing the feed of there camera on there screen untill unless they capture and then raplace the feed with the captured image, like how normally it works in cameras.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

1. KEEP THIS HIGHLY FANCY AND NOT GENERIC SINCE IT IS A PART OF A BIGGER EVENT.
2. FOLLOW PROPER TPYO HIERARCHY AND VISIBILITY
3. USE PROPER FONT PAIRS AND NOT GENERIC ONES
4. USE HIGHLY GOOD COLOR PALETTES.
5. THE INTERAFCE SHOULD NOT BE GENRIC, WE CAN EITHER PREVIEW THE VIDEO STREAM AND IMAGE INSIDE A SAFARI BROWSER MOCKUP OR LIKE GOOGLE MEET LIKE INTERFACE SO IT LOOKS HIGHLY INTERACTIVE IN EVERY MANNER.
6. THINK LIKE A SOPHISTICATED PRODUCT DESIGNER, AND NOT SOME GENERIC WANNABE AND ACT ACCORDINGLY.
7. THINK OF A GOOD LOGO AND GOOD NAME, AGAIN DO NOT BE GENERIC WITH ANY PLACEMENTS OR LAYOUT ON THE SCREE, IT IS A SINGLE SECTION WEBSITE ONLY.
8. WE CAN USE ANY WALLET PROVIDER FOR CONNECTING THE WALLET.
